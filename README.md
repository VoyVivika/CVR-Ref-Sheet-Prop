Spawnable Prop for Creating A Reference Sheet of your Avatar in ChilloutVR

# How to Get and Edit for myself?
To upload simply download this project (doing so via the Code Button will do just fine), open it, install the [ChilloutVR CCK](https://docs.abinteractive.net/cck/setup/) and then upload the project from the included scene.

# How to use in game
Stand in the Middle of the Platform and Take a Picture by either grabbing the cube on the right and clicking with it or placing your Camera inside of the Sphere on the Right.

This will not capture other players, only yourself. That can be modified if you so desire.

# Additional Notes
Amplify Shader Editor was used for the Shaders.
