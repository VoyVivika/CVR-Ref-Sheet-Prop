Spawnable Prop for Creating A Reference Sheet of your Avatar in ChilloutVR

To upload simply download this project (doing so via the Code Button will do just fine), open it, and then upload the project from the included scene.

To use simply stand in the Middle of the Platform and Take a Picture either using the Cube or placing your Camera inside of the Sphere on the Right.

This will not capture other players, only yourself. That can be modified if you so desire.
